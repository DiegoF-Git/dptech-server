## 📊 Step-by-Step Summary

### 1. Amazon EC2 Setup

* Logged into AWS Console and launched Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on t3.micro
* Created key pair `diegokey.pem`
* Configured security group to open ports 22, 80, and 443
* Allocated and associated an Elastic IP
* Used SSH from Windows Terminal:

```bash
ssh -i diegokey.pem ubuntu@3.107.180.255
```

* Installed Apache:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

* Verified Apache status and default page

### 2. Domain Registration & DNS

* Purchased `dptech.online` from Namecheap
* Configured A records (@ and www) to point to Elastic IP
* Verified DNS with:

```bash
dig dptech.online
nslookup dptech.online
ping dptech.online
wget http://dptech.online
```

### 3. TLS Certificate with Certbot

* Opened port 443 in AWS
* Installed Snap and Certbot:

```bash
sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

* Generated certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache
```

* Enabled HTTP to HTTPS redirect and confirmed via browser and:

```bash
curl -Iv https://dptech.online
```

### 4. Website Deployment (Version 1)

* Removed default index:

```bash
sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
```

* Uploaded initial website files:

  * `index.html`: homepage with service summary
  * `services.html`: expanded descriptions
  * `about.html`: team background
  * `contact.html`: basic form
  * `style.css`: base layout and colors
* Used SCP to upload files and adjusted permissions:

```bash
scp -i diegokey.pem *.html *.css ubuntu@3.107.180.255:/var/www/html/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/*
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### 5. Website Deployment (Version 2 - Final)

* Overhauled all HTML content with enriched, responsive layouts
* `index.html`: revised with clearer service cards, better structure, visual improvements
* `services.html`: enhanced clarity, icons, bullet structure for services
* `about.html`: includes Project Proposal and Licence Rationale from Assignment 1
* `contact.html`: new structure with icons, styled form, better UX
* `style.css`: expanded with typography, colors, mobile responsiveness

### 6. Backup Script

* Created folder structure and files:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/Documents
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/backup
touch /home/ubuntu/Documents/file1.txt
```

* Created script `/usr/bin/testscript`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
now=$(date +"%d_%m_%y")
mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/backup
cp -R /home/ubuntu/Documents/* /home/ubuntu/backup/
zip -r /home/ubuntu/backup/$now.zip /home/ubuntu/backup/*
scp -i /home/ubuntu/diegokey.pem /home/ubuntu/backup/$now.zip ubuntu@3.107.180.255:/home/ubuntu/
```

* Gave permissions:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/bin/testscript
```

* Tested manually: `/usr/bin/testscript`

### 7. Cron Job Setup

* Edited crontab:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/crontab
```

* Added line:

```bash
0 * * * * ubuntu /usr/bin/testscript
```

* Confirmed automation in logs and verified zip files
